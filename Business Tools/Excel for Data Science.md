# Why Excel? 

**1.Reporting** 

Data is often necessary in that format. Sometimes this is not a tool, this is only insight, so building a visualisation tool is not worth it. Excel allows the customer to play with the numbers and use them to compliment additional reports. 


**2. Visualisation** 

Excel allows you to open the file to see it, then it also allows you to play with the data like a dashboard, which is more human-friendly, and will help you to understand or identify patterns
faster 

Excel include some nice visualisation opportunities and specially python users (If they don't know R) can plot and present data in a more professional way.
