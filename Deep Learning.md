# Deploy Deep Learning to solve business problems 

**Software: Python & TensorFlow**

The good things of deep learning is that it can be used for everything, even for dimensionlity reduction. One important thing to notice is that deep learning is often not the solution for medium or low size data, or when the data is purely tabular (In this case, ensemble models tend to work better and are less expensive).

Top business contextes: 

* Add detection: To detect wether a website user will click on the advertising -> Show you the add that you're more likely to click on
* Photo Tagging 
* Real Estate
* Speech recognition / NLP
* Machine Translation
* Autonomus driving 

## Supervised Learning

Neural Network have taken off particularly in this type of ML. However, the areas where they make the difference are NLP and Computer Vision.

Hidden layes can be considered as underlying factors that together they alone improve the prediction of the previous layers
