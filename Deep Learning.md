# Deploy Deep Learning to solve business problems 

**Software: Python & TensorFlow**

The good things of deep learning is that it can be used for everything, even for dimensionlity reduction. One important thing to notice is that deep learning is often not the solution for medium or low size data, or when the data is purely tabular (In this case, ensemble models tend to work better and are less expensive).

Hidden layes can be considered as underlying factors that together they alone improve the prediction of the previous layers
